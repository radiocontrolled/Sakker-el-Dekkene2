# A Lebanese life in bribes

This is my fork of the interactive narrative on corruption in Lebanon I worked on at D4C Beirut.

It's based on data collected by <a href="https://www.sakkera.com/">Sakker el Dekkene</a> (SED), a Lebanese NGO which documents and publicises corruption. One of SED's key activities is collecting reports of bribery from the Lebanese public. 

The original designs for the narrative were conceived and at the D4C visualisation workshop in Beirut, 27 Nov - December 3 2015.

<a href="http://radiocontrolled.github.io/Sakker-el-Dekkene2/">Demo</a>. 

Please note it is in development. 

# Roadmap
