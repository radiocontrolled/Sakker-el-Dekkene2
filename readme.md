# A Lebanese life in bribes

This narrative is based on data collected by <a href="https://www.sakkera.com/">Sakker el Dekkene</a> (SED), a Lebanese NGO which documents and publicises corruption. One of SED's key activities is collecting reports of bribery from the Lebanese public. 

The designs for the narrative were conceived and at the D4C visualisation workshop in Beirut, 27 Nov - December 3 2015.

This <a href="http://radiocontrolled.github.io/Sakker-el-Dekkene2/">demo for the interactive</a> is my fork based on the team's work. Please note it is in development.
